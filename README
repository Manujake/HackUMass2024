Project Overview
The project consists of two main components:

Arduino Rover Control: The Arduino controls the rover’s movement by activating motor pins based on commands sent from the Raspberry Pi.
Raspberry Pi Server: The server communicates with the Arduino and manages event handling for executing commands.
The rover can perform the following actions:

Move forward
Move backward
Turn left
Turn right
Stop
The Raspberry Pi uses serial communication to send specific commands to the Arduino, which interprets them to control the motors.

Components
 - Arduino Uno: Controls the rover motors.
 - Raspberry Pi: Acts as the server to send commands.
 - Motor Driver Module: Connects to Arduino for motor control.
 - 4 DC Motors: Rover movement (connected via the motor driver).
 - Power Bank: Powers the Arduino and motors.
 - OTG Cable: Connects Arduino to Raspberry Pi via USB.

Running the Program
Power the Arduino with the power bank.
Start the Python server on the Raspberry Pi. This server can trigger commands that the Arduino interprets for motor control.
Send commands from the Raspberry Pi to the Arduino through the server code to control the rover’s movements as described in the code.
The rover will perform actions based on the received commands and will print status messages to the Serial Monitor for debugging.
